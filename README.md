# discord_bot

This is a simple discord bot made to generate X random numbers from 1-10. It will then determine the number of success and failues from those numbers. This simulates the dice rolling for the RPG Mage: The Awakening.

This bot also has a `!play <title>` command that will play the audio of the first video with the title in the user's audio channel

## To Use

Download the directory and `npm install` the required packages
Create a .env file with a discord token as `token` and a youtube api as `ytAPI`
